## Moodboard

Moodboard is an excuse to explore Python3 and Django - learn by doing!

I wanted a way to collect various images from around the internet for inspiration and reference in future projects. Supports multiple "boards", will download images to store locally and allows comments for additional information. Functionaly similar to a small pintrest clone without the social stuff. Will possibly expand in the future to include snippets of text, video and other media.
